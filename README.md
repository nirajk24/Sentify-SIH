# Sentiment Analysis Android App

Welcome to the README file for the Sentiment Analysis Android app built with Kotlin. This app is a powerful tool designed to provide users with deep insights into the sentiments and emotions expressed on Twitter. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter) for tweet scraping and machine learning models for sentiment analysis, this app offers a comprehensive dashboard to visualize emotional trends and sentiments. Additionally, it provides a feature to analyze the sentiment and emotion of any custom sentence, further extending its utility. The app also employs the [Anygraph](https://github.com/anychart/AnyChart-Android) library to draw visually appealing graphs for better data representation and user engagement.

## About the Project

The Sentiment Analysis Android app is meticulously crafted to offer users an immersive experience in understanding the emotions and sentiments prevalent across Twitter profiles, posts, and custom sentences. By harnessing the capabilities of Nitter for tweet scraping and sophisticated ML models for sentiment analysis, the app delivers a sophisticated dashboard that enables users to explore emotional nuances with ease and clarity.
